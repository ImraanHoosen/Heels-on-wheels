Heels on Wheels was started in the year 2021 by me; Yuhvina Nikki Singh. Being a female in the KZN motoring scene and also a show host, I faced challenges when I was told by a few gender-biased men that I did not belong in the car scene and should leave it to the professionals… the men. However, I decided to move forward wholeheartedly and founded Heels on Wheels.

<br>
<br>

Heels on Wheels is my baby, and I host many other events that are all charity-based. The aim is to continue empowering women of all walks of life; car enthusiasts, small business owners, abused women, single mothers, rape victims, unemployed women, youth, and cancer survivors to name a few.

<br>
<br>

Heels on Wheels is dedicated to remembering victims, shedding light on these matters, and standing in solidarity with women all over South Africa doing it the way we know best; through cars, love and God. It’s a testimony of my resilience as a woman who beat all odds and has given every woman in the automotive industry an opportunity to not let gender stop them from enjoying this amazing place called our Stance Scene.
